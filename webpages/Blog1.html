          <h2>What is technology? How are we surrounded by it?</h2>
          <p>
            Technology is an application of conceptual knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproductive way. The word technology can be both tangible such as utensils are machines or intangible such as a software. <br>
            Technology plays a very crucial role in science, engineering as well as daily human life. Technology and its development have made significant change in human life from the very beginning of evolvement of human beings. Growth of human brain, development of language and invention of wheel are some primary positive impact of technology during stone age, ice age and bronze age. <br>
            Everyday life has been significantly transformed by technology, which has an impact on everything from banking to healthcare to employment to education to home management and communication. Even worldwide connections are made possible by smartphones and social media, and the internet offers an abundance of informative resources. Technologies make it even easier to operate from home. Innovations in transportation include ride-sharing services and navigation, as well as online financial transactions that are simplified. E-learning is embraced by education, while automation is provided by smart houses. A significant component of everyday technology, printers assist with document handling. But with these technical advancements come ethical questions, such as privacy problems, which highlight how important responsible technology use is in our changing everyday lives. <br>
            However, even with advancements in technology, issues arise with our usage of it. Concerns include protecting our personal data, ensuring that everyone gets access to technology, and privacy. It's critical to strike a balance between making responsible use of technology and utilizing it for convenience. We must exercise caution and consider the moral implications of our actions as we navigate the technologically impacted aspects of daily life.
